        "question": "What are the steps to buying a property?",
        "answer": "Buying a property typically involves: 1) Getting pre-approved for a mortgage, 2) Finding a property that meets your needs, 3) Making an offer, 4) Getting a home inspection, 5) Securing financing, 6) Closing the deal. Our platform simplifies this process by connecting you with the right properties and providing resources for each step."
      },
      {
        "question": "How long does the buying process usually take?",
        "answer": "The buying process can vary widely depending on market conditions, property type, and financing arrangements. On average, from initial search to closing, you might expect 2-3 months. Some transactions can be completed more quickly, especially if you're a cash buyer, while others might take longer if there are complications with financing or inspections."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's the difference between a fixed and variable mortgage rate?",
        "answer": "A fixed-rate mortgage has the same interest rate for the entire term, offering payment stability since your monthly payments won't change. A variable-rate mortgage has an interest rate that can fluctuate based on market conditions. While variable rates often start lower than fixed rates, they carry the risk of increasing over time, which would increase your monthly payments."
      },
      {
        "question": "How much do I need for a down payment?",
        "answer": "Down payment requirements vary by location and property type. Generally, residential properties require 5-20% of the purchase price, with lower down payments usually requiring mortgage insurance. Commercial properties typically require 20-35% down. Many first-time homebuyer programs offer assistance with down payments, and we can connect you with financing options that match your situation."
      },
      {
        "question": "What additional costs should I budget for when buying a property?",
        "answer": "Beyond the purchase price, budget for: closing costs (2-5% of the loan amount), property taxes, homeowners insurance, potential HOA fees, home inspection fees, moving costs, and immediate repairs or renovations. We recommend setting aside a contingency fund of 1-3% of the home's value for unexpected expenses that may arise shortly after purchase."
